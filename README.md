# Markdown Previewer React App with TypeScript

This markdown previewer app was built using React, TypeScript and Sass.

See a live demo [here](https://synerjay.github.io/markdown-prev-typescript/).

I wanted to practice the principles of TypeScript in a React app and practice the standard practices of a TypeScripted React App.
